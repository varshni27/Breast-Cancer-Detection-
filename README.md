# Breast Cancer Detection

Breast cancer affected 2.3 million women globally in 2020, leading to 685,000 deaths. Early detection is critical as breast cancer can spread through metastasis, often showing no or minimal symptoms in its early stages. Machine learning offers a powerful tool for identifying malignant tumors based on features like size, concavity, and texture.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning models.
- **Dataset**: UCI Machine Learning Repository, comprising data from 569 patients and 33 attributes.
  
## Key Features of the Project
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  - Applied one-hot encoding to handle categorical variables.
  - Visualized key patterns using data visualization techniques.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
  - Achieved a high accuracy of **96.5%** on test data.
