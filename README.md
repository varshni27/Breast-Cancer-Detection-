# Breast-Cancer-Detection
As many as 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020, resulting in 685,000 deaths worldwide. With no or minimal symptoms in its early stages, breast cancer can progressively invade other tissues in the body through widespread metastasis. Breast cancer treatment can be highly effective, especially when detected in its premature stage. Machine learning can help detect cancerous or malignant tumours based on past data on the size, concavity and texture of tumours.
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains data of 569 patients with 33 attributes.
Predicted whether a tumour is malignant or benign based on its radius, texture, concavity, etc. 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, one-hot encoding, and data visualization on the dataset.
Implemented supervised ML models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier. Obtained an accuracy of 96.5% on test data.
